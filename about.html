<h4 style="margin-top: 48px;">About Me</h4>
<p>I am a Junior in the Electrical Engineering department of the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur. I like solving problems which involve code or electronics or preferably, both. I am no expert in one particular field, instead, I keep trying out problems from various domains and work on them. The primary function of this blog is to keep myself away from procrastinating. And doing so helps a lot even when I know when no one is going to read them in the foreseeable future. It also serves as a development log to record my work, so that if I have to pause the project for a while or reuse it at a later time, this will help to recollect the minute details.</p>
