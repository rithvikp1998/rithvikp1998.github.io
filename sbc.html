<h4 style="margin-top: 48px;">Prologue</h4>
<p>
	I am building a low power, small single board computer based on ARM Cortex-A8 processor from Texas Instruments. The first prototype of the board has been designed and printed, but I ran into some problems and looking for differnt ways to fix them. The goal is to make a working board that runs Linux and preferably a custom made kernel myOS.
