<p>
	myOS is a custom made 32-bit kernel currently being built on x86 and will be ported to ARM once it reaches a strong and stable state. The goal is to run this on the single board computer that I am building. Both SBC and myOS are a part of my 2017's New Year resolution, so the only deadline is Dec 31 2017. Until then, I'll keep building this and see where it reaches.
