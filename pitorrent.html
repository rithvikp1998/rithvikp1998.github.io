<p>
	piTorrent is a simple BitTorrent client written in Python 3. Just like everything else I do, there is nothing special about this except that I want to figure out how things work. I have looked a bit into the protocol and simple clients that other people built and it doesn't look code-heavy, so I added a little constraint here: I will build this as a 72-hour challenge, i.e., starting from reading the official spec, the entire project will be done in under 72 hours. [Update] The original plan to complete the project in 72 hours failed. So, I extended this to one week.
