My mid-semester exams are coming up and it only means one thing: I need every excuse to stay away from the incomplete assignments and lecture notes. So, I decided to do something interesting this weekend. Starting from tomorrow morning (Friday, 8 September, 2017), I'll spend the next 72 hours to build something new (outside of SBC and myOS, just to spice things up a little bit). I was looking for ideas that would fit in a 72-hour window and I came across the [BitTorrent protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) and BitTorrent clients that use the protocol and I have decided to build one. It fulfils all the requirements to become my personal project: I use it almost every day, there are plenty of online resources if I get stuck and I know absolutely nothing about how it works. So that's it then. A 72-hour self-organised and self-judged hackathon. The code will be hosted on [Github](https://github.com/rithvikp1998) as usual and all the commits will be in a 72 hour window. One thing though, I haven't decided if I would update the blog simultaneously or after the end of the hackathon.
