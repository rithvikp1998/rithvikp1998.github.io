This is my second attempt at writing a blog. The first time I tried, I didn't get past the introduction post. This time I think I have a good reason to go beyond that. Before I begin with that, let me introduce myself. I am a second year undergraduate(sophomore) in the Electrical engineering department of Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur. I am interested in building circuits, writing code, reading novels and listening to music. My primary interest is in processors, motherboards, embedded systems. Coming to the 'reason' I was saying, I planned to build a Single Board Computer (SBC) as a new year resolution ([Yep, inspired from Mark Zuckerberg's AI challenge](https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10102577175875681)). It should be able to run Linux primarily and if it works, I plan to write my own OS to run on that but more of that later. I will use this blog to post regular updates. The reason I'm starting this blog is to keep myself away from procrastinating. To a great year ahead!
