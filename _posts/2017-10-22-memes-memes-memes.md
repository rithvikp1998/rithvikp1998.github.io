I always thought I was the only one doing this, like starting a project and just when it could be completed, get stuck or get started in some other work and forgetting all about the old projects. But I could be wrong. Apparently, many devs do this. Nevertheless, I SHOULD stop making excuses because I feel that, for side projects, taking one(even if it's small) project and doing it from 0% to 100% is much much more fruitful than taking a bunch at a time and leave them half-completed. Long story short, in the last post I told you how I took a project offered by my senior. We had long discussions with professors and seniors from our college about the product we are proposing and came to the conclusion that we probably can make it a successful product by entering the market quickly and making great marketing plans as the technical part of it is not novel and anyone can do it. So, we decided it is not worth our time to do it because we are engineers, not marketing or sales or management people. The only thing that the two of us can do is make a technically strong and novel product and if we can't do it, there is no point to it. So, we dropped it and put on our thinking caps looking for better product ideas. In the last post I complained that this project was taking all my time and now I dropped it. If you think that now I have time to go back to my side projects, that's where you are wrong. Remember my GSoC project? Well, I never explained what it is, so atleast remember that I did something in this year's GSoC? Well, after the GSoC period was over, I reached to <a href="https://launchpad.net/~till-kamppeter">Till (Kamppeter)</a> and asked if I can keep contributing to OpenPrinting as that is one of the most important goals of GSoC program, to get permanent contributors. He agreed and gave me some tasks that I can pick up, the most urgent being the completion of our GSoC project and get it upstream before Ubuntu 18.04 feature freeze in February. It may seem a long time but it isn't especially because there are going to be a lot of code reviews, changes, etc. and many reviewers/developers/maintainers have full time jobs outside open source. Plus, there is still some coding left to do in the project itself. So, now, all of my free time goes here. I have no regrets though, as open source projects are more exciting and better learning experience than personal side projects. Plus, I have a lot of time during the winter vacation in December, so I can still complete my resolutions. Let's see.
