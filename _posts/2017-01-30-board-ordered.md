I just placed the order for the board and rest of the components. I decided to stick to my old design of unmatched trace lengths since even if I decide to build the board again, the error will be in the same margin as now, maybe a little bit less but I am ready to take the risk. Nevertheless, I learnt things that I planned to learn, so the purpose is served. Also, I am going to start working on the OS part now irrespective of the board working or not.
