I started working on the OS part of the project and with every step, the project is getting more interesting. I thought schematic part is the only interesting thing, but the PCB designing part was much more challenging and fun. Now, writing an OS is much more challenging as I have no prior experience in this field. At least in the hardware part, I knew stuff like what capacitors are used for, or how to design a PCB and other things that helped me begin. But now, nothing! Well, not nothing, I know what boot loaders are, what compilers do and some other things but it is not as much as I knew in the hardware part. And that's what makes it much more interesting!
