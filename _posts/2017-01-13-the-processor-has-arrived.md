The processor that I ordered from Texas Instruments has arrived. I know, I know, the correct order is: Design the board, then order the components. But what if I design the board completely and the processor goes out of stock? (I am not kidding, it happened with me once) Also, there is no loss in ordering in advance, so I ordered it and it has arrived.
