There are only 2 packages that are both  free and good, Eagle Community and KiCad. Eagle is the industry leader but the free package has some limitations(most don't apply to my project) and not-so-good-to-look interface but it has huge collection of component libraries. KiCad is a newer and the interface is easy to use and good to look at. But here are the points that swung my decision, routing in Eagle was not very easy and in KiCad, you choose the schematic symbol first and then pair that symbol with a footprint much later. I have used both of them and I chose KiCad. Update (19-01-2016): Eagle free edition is limited to 2 signal layers only, but I need more layers for my board. +1 for KiCad. Eagle student version needs .edu email-id, but there are many students in India, whose college doesn't give .edu id, who would love to use Eagle. I hope Eagle (now owned by Autodesk) would change this.
