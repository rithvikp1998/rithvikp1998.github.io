Like I said, I started on working on my OS, literally. Yes, unable to come up with a new name, I settled with dumb old 'myOS'. Actually, that is not completely true, I was not interested in spending hours to come up with the smartest name I can think of at the time, only to realise few days later that it sounds really dumb. Coming back to topic, my initial plan was to test the board, fix errors, run Linux on it and if it works, start writing an OS for THAT board. But the board is going to take 3 weeks to be delivered and I lost my patience after just 3 days of ordering the board and I started writing an OS. Also, my plan was to write OS for my board i.e. ARM based but I ended up writing x86 based OS. Why? The resources were aplenty and my goal is to learn how OSes are designed and this will serve the purpose. If the board works, I'll write another OS but based on ARM.
