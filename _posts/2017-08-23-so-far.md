Okay, its been a really long time since the last udpate because I got busy of some other important work. Anyways, much has changed since then and the kernel reached a not-so-bad state. So far, the kernel has physical and virtual memory management, terminal screen, keyboard support and few print statements for easy debugging. I am currently working on implementing AHCI support so that I can start handling disks. After that I'd start with process management or file systems. Then I'd create user space, system calls, threads etc. If I have time left after all this, which I doubt since there are only 4 months left, I have to start with graphics or networking probably. But more of that later. One thing though: I have been skipping on documentation and unit testing which is a bad way to proceed, so I have to take some time and complete them. And I'll try to keep this more technical from now on. Let's see.
