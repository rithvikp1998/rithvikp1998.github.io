It has been several weeks now and honestly I gave up. Following up my last post, the second set of packages have been shipped by OSHPark and OSHStencils on 14 Mar and 22 Feb respectively. And the same thing happened again. The packages left US but there has been no followup in India. My speculation is that, since I gave my college hostel's address, the customs **assumed **it is for commercial purposes(Similar thing happened with TI's ICs in the past which were shipped by FedEx. But FedEx India contacted me to submit import documents when I clarified the ICs are for non commercial purposes only and it hasn't happened since). I tried to complain with the respective courier companies but both are US based, so no Indian contact number and a written complaint can only be submitted by the sender. I informed the companies of the same and I am waiting for the replies. But like I said, I am not going to raise my hopes. At the same time, I started looking for Indian PCB manufacturers and I'll place the order if I find a trust worthy company who are selling the boards cheaply (OSHPark did it for $20).
