<img src="/images/meme.jpg"> 'A picture can say a thousand words'. In my case, this meme says it all. Let's recap 2017 as there are only a couple of months left. I started the year with ambitious projects to build a SBC and myOS. SBC came to a halt when the boards arrived but had errors and I don't know if I have to fix them and continue or try a different design altogether. myOS got paused due to GSoC after which I resumed and now I am stuck at getting VGA graphics mode to work and SATA drive to be detected and I am having a tough time debugging them. In the meantime, I felt like taking a break and started piTorrent as an even more ambitious hackathon, big mistake. As expected, it didn't get over in time and I thought I would complete it ASAP, but then came mid semester exams and I went home thinking I would start working on it as soon as I get back to college. I came back to college and guess what, one of my seniors offered that we make a team and participate in a competition by Samsung. The deadline is near and there is a lot of work to do, especially since our idea relies on electronics and the aforesaid senior, an expert in Software Engineering, is unfamiliar with electronics. And as expected, I took the offer, because I believe our simple idea has good potential to become a standalone product in the future, that has to be seen. But all of this means that I am now spending all of my free time on this new project. I know, I know, it is getting worse with each passing day. I have to become a time management wizard and stop procrastinating in my free time if I want to complete all the projects without entering a 'denial' kind of phase where I get overwhelmed and stop doing anything altogether and spend my days binge-watching TV shows oblivious to the world outside my room.
