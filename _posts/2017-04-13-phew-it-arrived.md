I received both the PCBs and the stencils a few days ago. Finally. So as expected I got down to soldering the components with full enthu, only to realise the two mistakes I've done that are now going to cost me heavily. **Mistake #1:** Never ever go to the extremes. 0603 SMD size is the smallest size that can be hand soldered and I went for it, for it appeared big enough when I made a paper cut of the same size. But as you can see in Fig. 1, it is too small. However, it is not impossible to solder. Only, I don't have an oven and I don't want to use the one in our college's PCB lab as placing all those components is going to take some time and sitting in a lab surrounded by impatient technicians is not going to help it. So, I stuck to the heat gun I borrowed from AUV's inventory and the only problem is the nozzle's too big. Also I noted down in my small notepad that the maximum size I can go for some of the capacitors is 0805(I didn't note down the reason why, but if I wrote it down, it must have been because I read it in one of the guides and I didn't understand the reason properly). It is going to take some time to solder all those pesky little capacitors and resistors and I'm happy to do it if not for my Mistake #2 **Mistake #2:** The buck converters from Ti come in a 8-uSIP package which is close to MSOP-8 or at least I thought so until I realised I made a calculation error and the       3mm x 3mm MSOP package is too big for the 3mm x 2.4mm uSIP package. Damn! Even if the footprint was 3mm x 2.7mm, I would have had no trouble. What a 0.6mm error can do! The only option I got now is to solder single strand extension to increase the pad size by around 0.3mm whereas the entire footprint is 3mm long with a heat-sink in the centre. Though I didn't expect the board to work the first time itself (that would be a miracle), footprint errors are some of the least expected. Nevertheless, I AM GOING TO COMPLETE IT, but it is going to take some time now as exams are fast approaching!
